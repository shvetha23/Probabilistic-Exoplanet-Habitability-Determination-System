# Probabilistic Exoplanet Habitability Determination System

##Description
‘Probabilistic Exoplanet Habitability Determination System’ uses a Bayesian network to determine as to whether an Exoplanet could be considered habitable or not based on the available information present for that particular Exoplanet

##Run
1.	Copy the file ExoPlanetDetermination.dne to your system
2.	Compile the network
3.	Plug in the available information (i.e. Mass, Radius)
4.	The changes will be reflected in the connected nodes
